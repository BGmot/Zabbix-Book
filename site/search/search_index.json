First we need to make sure our firewall is installed</p> <p><code>dnf install firewalld --now</code></p> <p>Our firewall is installed now and we are ready to configure the needed ports. For our zabbix server we need to allow access to port 10051/tcp this is the port where our zabbix trapper listens on for incoming data.</p> <p><code>firewall-cmd --add-service=zabbix-server --permanent</code> or  <code>firewall-cmd --add-port=10051/tcp --permanent</code></p> <p>Another thing we need to configure is the setup of timeserver and sync our zabbix server to the timeserver by making use of an ntp client. This needs to be done for the Zabbix server but also for the devices we will monitor as time is very important for Zabbix. Imagine one of our hosts having a timezone that is wrong we could end up looking for a problems in Zabbix that happened 6h ago while it had happened maybe only 2h ago.</p> <p><code>dnf install chronyd --now</code></p> <p>Once Chrony is installed we also need to setup our correct timezone. <pre><code>timedatectl\n               Local time: Thu 2023-11-16 15:09:14 UTC\n           Universal time: Thu 2023-11-16 15:09:14 UTC\n                 RTC time: Thu 2023-11-16 15:09:15\n                Time zone: UTC (UTC, +0000)\nSystem clock synchronized: yes\n              NTP service: active\n          RTC in local TZ: no\n</code></pre></p> <p>Make sure NTP is active q We can choose the correct timezone from a list that we can lookup with the following command</p> <p><code>timedatectl list-timezones</code></p> <pre><code>Africa/Abidjan\nAfrica/Accra\n\n...\n\nPacific/Tongatapu\nPacific/Wake\nPacific/Wallis\nUTC\n</code></pre> <p>We can now configure our correct timezone </p> <pre><code>timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Brussels\n</code></pre> <pre><code># timedatectl\n               Local time: Thu 2023-11-16 16:13:35 CET\n           Universal time: Thu 2023-11-16 15:13:35 UTC\n                 RTC time: Thu 2023-11-16 15:13:36\n                Time zone: Europe/Brussels (CET, +0100)\nSystem clock synchronized: yes\n              NTP service: active\n          RTC in local TZ: no\n</code></pre> <p>We can test if our Chrony is syncronizing with the correct timeservers as well by running the command chronyc</p> <pre><code># chronyc\nchrony version 4.2\nCopyright (C) 1997-2003, 2007, 2009-2021 Richard P.
