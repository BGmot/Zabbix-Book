# Zabbix hosts

To understand how Zabbix works it's important to know that ```Host``` in Zabbix are a reference to anything we would like to monitor it can be a physical host, a virtual machine, an application a device or even just a dummy host used to calculate data from existing other hosts into something new.

Its probably one of the first tasks that we will do as an Admin when we first login to Zabbix because we need a host if we would like to monitor some metrics. It's however important to know that hosts cannot be created without them being in a hostgroup. 

With this said let's create our first host.

Let's go to the menu on our ```Left``` and select Data Collection.
