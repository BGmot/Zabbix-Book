# Starting with the basics

This chapter is going to cover the basics we need to know when it comes to the Zabbix userinterface and the thing we need ot know before we can start to fully dive into our monitoring tool. We will see how the userinteface works how to add a host, groups users, items ... so that we have a good understanding of the basics. This is something that is sometimes missed and can lead to frustrations not knowing why things don't work like we had expected them to work. So even if you are an advanced user it may be usefull to have a look into this chapter.


## Zabbix Interface

With Zabbix 7 the user interface after logging in is a bit changed. Our menu on the left side of the screen has has a small overhaul. Let's dive into it.
When we login into our Zabbix setup the first time with our Admin user we see a page like this where we have our ```main window``` in green our ```main menu``` marked in red and our ```links``` marked in yellow.

The main menu can be hidden by collapsing it completely or to reduce it to a set of small icons. 


When we click on the button with the 2 arrows to the left:

![Image title](CH02/small-menu.png/){ width="200" } 

You will see that the menu collapses to a set of small icons. Pressing ">>" will bring the ```main menu``` back to it's original state. Pressing the box with the arrow sticking out next to the "<<" button will hide the ```main menu``` completely.

 To get the main menu back it's not too difficult we just look for the button on the left with three horizontal lines and click it. This will bring the menu back and clicking on the box with the arrow agian will bring the ```main menu``` back.

Yet another way to make the screen bigger that is quit useful for monitors in NOK teams for example is the kiosk mode button. This one is however located on the left side of your screen and looks like 4 arrows pointing to every corner of the screen. Pressing this button will remove all the menus and leave only main window to focus on.

![Image title](CH02/kiosk-menu.png/){ width="70" } ![Image title](CH02/exitkiosk-menu.png/){ width="70" }

When wanting to leave the kios mode the button will be changed to 2 arrows poiting to the inside of the screen. Pressing this button will revert us back to the original state.
