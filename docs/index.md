# What is this book about ?

Hi, welcome and thanks for your interest in my Zabbix book. I wrote a few books a few years ago when i started with Zabbix.
As Zabbix is an opensource product and making money out of the book was never my intention it got me thinking. 
How to make a new book without using a publisher like I had done before.
After a while I came up with the idea to make a book that would be free and that would be updated when new versions came out.
Since I am a huge fan of documetation in markdown or asciidoc I came up with the idea to share the book in git and use markdown.
The problem here is that it's probably not the best way to make a book readable so after some searching for a good solution based on markdown I found [MkDocs](www.mkdocs.org). MkDocs is a Python-Markdown library that can convert everything to HTML and can be templated.


# Who am I ?

My name is Patrik Uytterhoeven and I work for a Belgium company named Open-Future. I started at this company at Januari 2013 and thats
when my journey started with Zabbix aswel. They gave me the opportunity to build my experience and to get certified as Zabbix trainer.
Since this year I am officialy 10y Zabbix trainer. If you would like to follow one of my trainings feel free to register for a training at our website [www.open-future.be](www.open-future.be)

# What OS do I need ?

Since I work mostly with RHEL based systems and since I am convinced that RHEL is the better choice in Production environments I have chosen to focus on using one of the forks that is available. Zabbix is supported on Ubuntu, Debian, Suse, Debian, .... and it can be compiled on any OS that is Unix based so it's almost impossible to cover them all. However the book is Opensource and in GIT so feel free to contribute the code for your favorite flavour :). I wil use Rocky 9 in this book but it should work for most of the other installations as well.


# How to use this book ?

The book will try to cover all the topics feel free to let me know if something is missing or feel free to make a pull request. 
There is no need to start from page 1 and read the book till the end. Some people will be looking for basic knowledge others might want to skip to the fun part so I want the book to be useful for everyone. Therefor I will try to explain as good as possible in every topic the exact steps needed to reproduce.
 
There will be moments in the book where you need to type some code, I will show the commands you need to type in a box just like here.

```
# some command 
```

Notes to some useful documentation will be added at the bottom of the page.


Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference.


In case there is some important information to share I will add notes in the documentation like can be seen here :
